# L0176 vs. the Learnosity question-type documentation

A working checklist. L0176's builders and registries in
`packages/core/src/question-types.ts` were ported byte-for-byte from L0158 and had
never been read against Learnosity's own reference documentation. This records
what that comparison turned up, organised so we can settle it **one question type
at a time**.

Work a section, decide what (if anything) to change, then flip its **Status**.

**All sections are closed.** Every question type has been converted and every
cross-cutting finding resolved; what is left is not reading but rendering. See
"What is not settled" at the end.

**Status legend:** `unreviewed` · `reviewed` (looked at, nothing to do) · `fixed` ·
`wontfix` (understood and deliberately left).

## Constraint on any fix

L0176's compiled output passed a 117/117 golden-output parity gate against L0158.
Changing what an *existing* program emits breaks that gate. Prefer additive
changes — new optional attributes, newly-accepted values — and call it out
explicitly when a change alters existing output.

## Sources

The docs are cached at `~/work/learnosity/question-types-docs/` (51 articles,
retrieved 2026-08-20, regenerate with `node fetch.mjs`). Where the articles contradict *each
other* rather than contradicting L0176, the conflict is recorded in
`packages/core/spec/conflict-resolution.md` and referenced from here by number. Per-type sections below
name the file. Learnosity's public pages 403 non-browser clients; the cache came
from the Zendesk Help Center JSON API — see that folder's `README.md`.

Two articles carry more than their titles suggest:

- **`Chemistry-formula-chemistry.md`** is the only page with the complete
  `validation.*.value[].method` enumeration and its `options` sub-attributes. The
  math types reference these without listing them.
- **`Math-formula-Deprecated.md`** shows the predicate methods in use, emitted
  with **no `value` key**.

# Cross-cutting

## A. Registries are declared but never enforced

**Status:** **fixed** — enforced for all 13 types; the dead fields are gone

Three declarations in `question-types.ts` describe validation that does not
happen. Nothing imports or reads any of them:

| Declaration | Line | Consumers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `validAttributes` | `question-types.ts` | **the 8 converted types** — enforced in each builder; `mcq`, `classification`, `bowtie`, `token-highlight`, `clozeformula` and `custom` are still unchecked |
| `attributeFields[*].allowed` | `question-types.ts:901` | none |
| `attributeFields[*].valueType` | `question-types.ts:877-906` | none |

`compiler.ts` generates one Checker/Transformer method per entry of
`questionTypeBuilders` and `attributeFields` (`compiler.ts:217`, `:228`, `:503`,
`:524`) and reads only `meta.field` (`:544`). So:

- **Any attribute keyword can be attached to any question type.** The builder
  destructures the ones it knows and forwards everything else through `...rest`
  straight into the emitted question JSON. `stimulus … passage "x" (mcq {})` emits
  a `passage` field on an `mcq`.
- **`method` accepts any string.** `method "nonsense"` compiles and reaches
  `validation.valid_response.value[].method`.

The one attribute with real per-type gating is `partial-credit`, and it is
enforced imperatively in the builders via `PARTIAL_CREDIT_TYPES`
(`question-types.ts:99-120`) — not via `validAttributes`.

`CLAUDE.md:53` lists `validAttributes` as one of the registries the compiler is
driven by, which is not the case.

This matters for the rest of this document: several per-type findings below are
about entries in `validAttributes`. Those are wrong-as-documentation today, and
would become wrong-as-behaviour the moment the table is wired up.

**Resolved.** `validAttributes` is consumed by every builder, so an attribute
that is not the type's own is a compile error rather than a field riding silently
onto the question. `attributeFields` became `memberFields`, and its unused
`allowed` and `valueType` are gone — `method` is deliberately unchecked (C1) and
value shapes are checked where they carry structure (`shape`) rather than
declared and ignored. `scoring-type` is checked per type against `SCORING_TYPES`,
which is the one piece of the old `allowed` idea that had evidence behind it.

## B. Author API widget list

**Status:** **fixed** — list rebuilt from the question-type catalog

`author.ts:18-41` hardcodes the `widgetTypes` offered by the Author Site. Seven of
the 23 entries do not name a current Learnosity type:

| Entry | Status per the docs |
| --- | --- |
| `fillintheblanks` | not a Learnosity type — no article, no slug |
| `clozeinlinetext` | not a Learnosity type — no article, no slug |
| `highlighttext` | not a Learnosity type (the deprecated one is `texthighlight`) |
| `longtext` | deprecated — current is `longtextV2` |
| `formula` | deprecated — current is `clozeformulaV2` |
| `imageclozeassociation` | deprecated — current is `imageclozeassociationV2` |
| `sortlist` | deprecated — cannot be newly authored from v2026.1.LTS |

The list also omits `bowtie`, which L0176 itself supports.

**Resolved.** The list is rebuilt from the question-type catalog: the three
non-types are gone, the four deprecated slugs are replaced by their current
equivalents, and every type L0176 emits is present. Six types L0176 does not yet
emit but the Author Site can author are kept, and marked as such.

## C. Question metadata

**Status:** **fixed** — the join is gone and the documented fields are exposed

Learnosity documents `metadata.distractor_rationale_response_level` as
`array[string]` — one rationale per response — which is exactly L0176's
per-distractor use case. `translateQuestionMetadata`
(`question-types.ts:136-139`) instead joins the list into a single numbered string
in `metadata.distractor_rationale`.

**Resolved.** `distractor-rationale` now emits a single string unchanged, and
`distractor-rationale-response-level` is its own member taking the list — which is
what Learnosity documents for per-option intent, and was previously unreachable.
`sample-answer`, `rubric-reference` and `response-shuffle-seed` are exposed too.

Worth reflecting in `spec/`: Learnosity states the Questions API provides **no
built-in UI** for distractor rationale — the data is in the question JSON and the
host environment must render it.

## D. `spec/` accuracy

**Status:** **fixed** — both sections rewritten

1. `spec/instructions.md:250-311` ("Scoring math responses") documents four
   methods — `equivLiteral`, `equivSymbolic`, `equivValue`, `isSimplified`. The
   `METHOD` registry entry names eight, and Learnosity documents two more on top
   of that (see [`clozeformula`](#clozeformula--clozeformulav2)). Undocumented
   methods are unreachable in practice: the generator writes from `instructions.md`.
2. `spec/usage-guide.md` said per-distractor rationale is shown "in the Author
   Site review pane". True there, but the Questions API renders nothing for it at
   delivery — the host must.

**Resolved.** The math-methods section was rewritten for the rule-object form and
now names the predicate methods (`isExpanded`, `isFactorised`, `isTrue`,
`validSyntax`) that carry no `value` and `isUnit`, which does take one. Since C1
and C2 were closed by rendering it also carries the measured method set, the
warning that an unknown method scores every response 0, and the warning that an
unknown `options` key is ignored in silence. It no longer documents the deleted
nested-answer-list form.
`usage-guide.md` carries the Questions API caveat, and seven of its cues were
rewritten where they described vocabulary that no longer exists.

# Per question type

## `mcq` → `mcq`

**Status:** **fixed** — converted to the aligned vocabulary, 2026-08-20
**Docs:** `Multiple-choice-mcq.md` · **Builder:** `question-types.ts:155` ·
**Attributes:** `question-types.ts:924`

No defect. Option shape `{label, value: "<index>"}` matches the documented default
("the option array index as a string"), and `validation.valid_response.value` is
`array[string]` as documented.

Documented and unexposed, for later: `min_selection` / `max_selection` (gated on
`multiple_responses`), `feedback_attempts`, `ui_style.type`
(`horizontal` / `block` / `horizontal-input-bottom`), `ui_style.choice_label`,
`ui_style.columns`, `ui_style.orientation`, `options[].assistive_label`.

## `shorttext` → `shorttext`

**Status:** **fixed** — converted to the aligned vocabulary, 2026-08-20
**Docs:** `Short-text-shorttext.md` · **Builder:** `question-types.ts:206` ·
**Attributes:** `question-types.ts:925`

No defect.

Documented and unexposed: `character_map`, `spellcheck`,
`ignore_leading_and_trailing_spaces` (default `true`),
`validation.accent_sensitivity`, `validation.enable_fullwidth_scoring`, and
`validation.valid_response.matching_rule` — whose `"contains"` value matches a
correct word appearing as a distinct whole word anywhere in the response.

Note Learnosity's `max_length` default is 50 and its cap is 250; L0176 sets no
default for `shorttext` and passes the author's value straight through, so an
out-of-range value is Learnosity's to reject.

## `longtext` → `longtextV2`

**Status:** **fixed** — converted to the aligned vocabulary, 2026-08-20
**Docs:** `Essay-with-rich-text-longtextV2.md` · **Builder:** `question-types.ts:251` ·
**Attributes:** `question-types.ts:926`

No defect. The keyword→slug remap is correct: bare `longtext` is the deprecated
type (see [B](#b-author-api-widget-list)).

Documented and unexposed: `formatting_options` (the toolbar), `show_word_limit`,
`show_word_count`, `submit_over_limit`, `character_map`, `disable_auto_link`, and
the Feedback Aide AI-scoring pair `validation.score_with_feedbackaide` /
`validation.feedbackaide_passages` (premium; needs `validation.rubric`).

## `plaintext` → `plaintext`

**Status:** **fixed** — converted to the aligned vocabulary, 2026-08-20
**Docs:** `Essay-with-plain-text-plaintext.md` · **Builder:** `question-types.ts:276` ·
**Attributes:** `question-types.ts:927`

No defect.

Documented and unexposed: `show_copy` / `show_cut` / `show_paste`,
`show_word_limit`, `submit_over_limit`, `character_map`, `spellcheck`.

## `clozetext` → `clozetext`

**Status:** **fixed** — converted to the aligned vocabulary, 2026-08-20
**Docs:** `Cloze-text-clozetext.md` · **Builder:** `question-types.ts:301` ·
**Attributes:** `question-types.ts:928`

### Finding: `stimulus` is written to `template`, and no `stimulus` is emitted

Shared with `clozeassociation`, `clozedropdown`, and `clozeformula`.

Learnosity documents these as two separate fields: `stimulus` is the prompt shown
above the response area, `template` is the passage carrying the `{{response}}`
blanks. Its own example sets both — `"stimulus": "fill in the blanks"` plus a
`template` table.

L0176 assigned the DSL's `stimulus` to `template` and never emitted a `stimulus`,
so a cloze question could not carry a prompt distinct from its passage.

**Resolved for `clozetext`, `clozeassociation` and `clozedropdown`.** Each now has
both attributes, emitting their own fields. Still open for `clozeformula`, which
is unconverted.

### What the conversion changed

- `stimulus` and `template` are separate attributes emitting their own fields.
- Scoring moved into a `validation` block mirroring Learnosity's object.
  `valid-response` takes one member list (`[score 1 value ["cat"]]`) because
  `valid_response` is one object; `alt-responses` takes a list of member lists
  because `alt_responses` is an array. `score` and `value` are arity-1 members,
  merged per L0169's `ASSESS` pattern.
- `partial-credit` and `alternative-response` are gone from this type.
  `scoring-type` is written directly, which also reaches `partialMatchV2` — a
  third mode the boolean could not express — and an unsupported value is now a
  compile error rather than a silent fallback to `exactMatch`.
- The whole documented attribute surface is exposed (19 attributes, up from 8),
  which cost nothing: an aligned attribute needs no builder code.
- `validAttributes.CLOZETEXT` is now **enforced**, so an attribute belonging to
  another type is rejected instead of riding `...rest` onto the question.

**Still open for this type.** `max_length` defaults to 15 characters per blank and
L0176 emits no default, so a generated question silently caps typed input — and
`spec/examples.md:59` asks for the answer "seat of government", 18 characters.
Documented now in `spec/`, but whether L0176 should emit a default is undecided:
doing so would inject a value the author did not write.

`metadata.distractor_rationale_response_level` remains unexposed — see
[C](#c-question-metadata).

## `clozeassociation` → `clozeassociation`

**Status:** **fixed** — converted to the aligned vocabulary, 2026-08-20
**Docs:** `Cloze-with-drag-drop-clozeassociation.md` · **Builder:** `question-types.ts:338` ·
**Attributes:** `question-types.ts:929`

No defect beyond the shared `stimulus`/`template` finding under
[`clozetext`](#clozetext--clozetext). `possible_responses` is a flat
`array[string]` as documented (contrast `clozedropdown` below).

Documented and unexposed: `duplicate_responses`, `shuffle_options`,
`group_possible_responses`, `ui_style.possibility_list_position`,
`ui_style.show_drag_handle`, `max_response_per_zone`.

## `clozedropdown` → `clozedropdown`

**Status:** **fixed** — converted to the aligned vocabulary, 2026-08-20
**Docs:** `Cloze-with-drop-down-clozedropdown.md` · **Builder:** `question-types.ts:373` ·
**Attributes:** `question-types.ts:930`

No defect beyond the shared `stimulus`/`template` finding under
[`clozetext`](#clozetext--clozetext). `possible_responses` is correctly
`array[array[string]]` — one array per drop-down, in order of appearance — and the
default at `question-types.ts:38` is correctly nested.

Documented and unexposed: `shuffle_options`, `case_sensitive`,
`match_all_possible_responses`, per-menu `response_containers` sizing/placeholder.
Note the response format returns `null` for an unanswered menu.

## `clozeformula` → `clozeformulaV2`

**Status:** **fixed** — converted to the aligned vocabulary, 2026-08-20
**Docs:** `Math-clozeformulaV2.md` (the emitted type), `Cloze-math-clozeformula.md`
(the same-named older type), `Chemistry-formula-chemistry.md` (the method list) ·
**Builder:** `question-types.ts:428` · **Attributes:** `question-types.ts:931`

The densest section. Note first that the L0176 keyword and the Learnosity slug
disagree: `clozeformula` emits `type: "clozeformulaV2"` (`question-types.ts:442`),
which Learnosity calls **"Math"**. Learnosity's own `clozeformula` ("Cloze math")
is a different, older type L0176 does not emit.

### Finding 1: `METHOD.allowed` omits two documented methods

`question-types.ts:901` lists
`equivLiteral, equivSymbolic, equivValue, isSimplified, isFactorised, isExpanded, stringMatch, isUnit`.

Learnosity's enumeration (`Chemistry-formula-chemistry.md`) is
`equivSymbolic, equivLiteral, equivValue, stringMatch, equivSyntax, isTrue`.

`equivSyntax` and `isTrue` are documented and absent from L0176's list — and
`isTrue` appears in Learnosity's own `clozeformula` example. Conversely
`isSimplified`, `isFactorised`, `isExpanded` and `isUnit` are in L0176's list but
appear only on the deprecated `formula` / `formulaV2` pages and the Author Guide;
they are legacy math methods carried over from L0158, not currently enumerated.

Nothing enforces the list either way — see [A](#a-registries-are-declared-but-never-enforced).

**Closed by rendering.** Chemistry's six were neither: the real set is the eleven
scoring methods Learnosity's own scorer names (plus five math-engine actions), and
all three of L0176's supposedly-invented methods are real. `question-types.ts`
now enforces it — see **C1** in `packages/core/spec/conflict-resolution.md`.
Superseded guidance follows; do not widen or narrow
`METHOD.allowed` until that closes.

### Finding 2: value-less predicate methods cannot be expressed

`isTrue`, `isExpanded`, `isFactorised` and `isSimplified` are predicates on the
learner's response, not comparisons against an answer. Learnosity's examples emit
them with **no `value` key**:

```json
{ "method": "isTrue",     "options": { "decimalPlaces": 10 } }
{ "method": "isExpanded" }
```

`buildClozeformula` always emits `value: v` (`question-types.ts:453-462`), and the
rule is only constructed at all when `valid-response` is present
(`question-types.ts:452`). There is no way to author a predicate-only blank, and
`method "isSimplified"` — which `spec/instructions.md:311` actively recommends —
therefore emits a shape Learnosity does not document.

The most substantive finding in this document, and a design change rather than a
one-line fix: it needs a DSL spelling for "this blank is scored by a predicate".

### Finding 3: emitted scoring `options` are off-spec

L0176 emits, for every rule:

```json
"options": { "ignoreOrder": false, "setDecimalSeparator": ".",
             "setThousandsSeparator": [], "inverseResult": false }
```

`Math-clozeformulaV2.md` documents only `decimalPlaces` and `setDecimalSeparator`
for this type. `ignoreOrder` and `setThousandsSeparator` appear only in the
`multistepmath` example; `inverseResult` only on the `chemistry` page. All three
are real, just not documented for `clozeformulaV2`.

Tracked as **C2** in `packages/core/spec/conflict-resolution.md`, where the full split is laid
out: the `options` bag is documented as two disjoint sets and neither table matches its own
article's examples. C2 gates the `clozeformula` redesign.

Consequence worth noting: L0176 never sets `decimalPlaces`, so `equivValue` always
runs at Learnosity's default of 10 significant decimal places.

### Finding 4: shared `stimulus`/`template` collapse

See [`clozetext`](#clozetext--clozetext).

Documented and unexposed: `ui_style.type` (keypad style — L0176 hardcodes
`block-on-focus-keyboard`), `ui_style.response_font_scale`,
`ui_style.min_width`, `ui_style.keyboard_below_response_area`, `text_blocks`,
`horizontal_layout`, `math_image_capture`, and `hints` (v2025.1.LTS) — note
L0176 already emits `show_hints_button: true` (`question-types.ts:446`) without
ever emitting the `hints` object it controls.

## `choicematrix` → `choicematrix`

**Status:** **fixed** — converted to the aligned vocabulary, 2026-08-20
**Docs:** `Choice-matrix-choicematrix.md` · **Builder:** `question-types.ts:515` ·
**Attributes:** `question-types.ts:932`

Mapping is correct: DSL `columns` → `options`, `rows` → `stems`, and
`validation.valid_response.value` is `array[array[number]]` of column indices per
row, as documented.

### Finding: `multiple-responses` is absent from the attribute table

Learnosity documents `multiple_responses` for `choicematrix` — it converts each
row's radios to checkboxes so a learner can select more than one option per row.
`validAttributes.CHOICEMATRIX` (`question-types.ts:932`) omits it, while
`MCQ` (`:924`) has it.

Because nothing enforces `validAttributes` ([A](#a-registries-are-declared-but-never-enforced)),
`multiple-responses true` on a `choicematrix` already works today — the builder
forwards it through `...rest`. So this is a documentation defect in a dead table,
not a functional restriction. It becomes a real one if the table is ever wired up.

Also unexposed: `ui_style.type` (`table` vs `inline`), `ui_style.stem_title`,
`ui_style.option_row_title`, `ui_style.stem_width` / `option_width`,
`ui_style.horizontal_lines`.

Related: Learnosity has a `nclex` sibling of this type (`nclexScoringByColumn` —
per-column tallies with a floor of zero) which L0176 does not expose, despite
supporting the NGN/NCLEX `bowtie`.

## `orderlist` → `orderlist`

**Status:** **fixed** — converted to the aligned vocabulary, 2026-08-20
**Docs:** `Order-list-orderlist.md` · **Builder:** `question-types.ts:556` ·
**Attributes:** `question-types.ts:933`

No defect.

Documented and unexposed: `shuffle_options`, `ui_style.type`
(`button` / `list` / `inline`), `ui_style.show_drag_handle`. Learnosity also
documents a fourth scoring type for this widget, `partialMatchPairwise`, which
L0176's binary `partial-credit` cannot select.

*(Doc bug, not ours: the article's own example sets `"ui_style": "button"` as a
bare string while its attribute table declares `ui_style` an object.)*

## `classification` → `classification`

**Status:** **fixed** — converted to the aligned vocabulary, 2026-08-20
**Docs:** `Classification-classification.md` · **Builder:** `question-types.ts:591` ·
**Attributes:** `question-types.ts:934`

No defect. `ui_style.column_count` / `column_titles` and the
`array[array[number]]` valid response indexed into `possible_responses` all match.

Documented and unexposed: `row_count` / `row_titles` / `row_header` (the 2-D grid
form — L0176 only ever emits a single row of columns), `max_response_per_cell`,
`duplicate_responses`, `shuffle_options`, `group_possible_responses`,
`ui_style.possibility_list_position`, `ui_style.show_drag_handle`.

Note this type has four partial-scoring modes (`partialMatch`,
`partialMatchV2`, `partialMatchElement`, `partialMatchElementV2`); L0176's
`partial-credit` always picks `partialMatch` (per cell).

## `bowtie` → `bowtie`

**Status:** **fixed** — converted to the aligned vocabulary, 2026-08-20
**Docs:** `Bow-tie-bowtie.md` · **Builder:** `question-types.ts:682` ·
**Attributes:** `question-types.ts:935`

`possible_response_groups` (`title` + `responses`), `group_possible_responses`,
and `ui_style.column_titles` all match the documented shape.

### Finding 1: `max_response_per_cell` is emitted but undocumented for this type

`question-types.ts:710` emits `max_response_per_cell: 1`. The bowtie attribute
table does not list it — it belongs to `classification`. Inert or ignored, most
likely; carried over from L0158.

### Finding 2: the doc's own worked example does not decode

`Bow-tie-bowtie.md` shows groups of 5 / 2 / 5 responses (12 total, indices 0–11)
with `valid_response.value` of `[[0, 4], [7], [10, 12]]`. Under cumulative global
indexing the middle group occupies 5–6, so `[7]` is in the wrong group, and `12`
is out of range entirely.

L0176 computes cumulative offsets across the groups
(`question-types.ts:646`, `:677-679`), which is the coherent reading, and that
output already passed golden parity against L0158. **Recording only — do not
"fix" toward the example.**

Tracked as **C8** in `packages/core/spec/conflict-resolution.md`, now **RESOLVED** by
rendering: cumulative global indexing is confirmed, and the article's example is
wrong. The parity gate proved agreement with L0158; the render proves agreement
with Learnosity.

Also note: the 2-1-2 answer shape L0176 enforces (`BOWTIE_AREA_COUNTS`,
`question-types.ts:635`) is not stated anywhere in the article — the docs say only
"an array with three elements representing each drop zone".

## `token-highlight` → `tokenhighlight`

**Status:** **fixed** — converted to the aligned vocabulary, 2026-08-20
**Docs:** `Token-highlight-tokenhighlight.md` · **Builder:** `question-types.ts:819` ·
**Attributes:** `question-types.ts:936`

No defect, and the closest match in the set. `tokenization: "custom"` plus
`<span class="lrn_token">…</span>` wrapping in `template`, with
`valid_response.value` as span indices in document order, is exactly what the
article specifies. `max_selection` matches. The `hot-text` → `token-highlight`
rename (`lexicon.ts:85`) aligns the keyword with the Learnosity widget name.

Learnosity's other `tokenization` values (`sentence`, `word`, `paragraph`) are
unreachable by design — L0176 always lists tokens explicitly.

## `custom` → `custom`

**Status:** reviewed — no defect; the only type L0176 does not transcribe, by design
**Docs:** `Custom-Draft.md` · **Builder:** `question-types.ts:737` ·
**Attributes:** *(no `validAttributes` entry)*

No defect. `custom_type`, `js.question`, `js.scorer` and `css` match the
documented shape. The extra `data` field L0176 emits is not a Learnosity attribute
but is consumed by the custom question's own JS, which is the point of the type.

Two notes: Learnosity labels this type **Draft**; and `CUSTOM` has no entry in
`validAttributes` at all — inconsequential today, see
[A](#a-registries-are-declared-but-never-enforced).

---

# Appendix — coverage

All 51 documented types. L0176 maps 14 of the 41 current types; 27 are unmapped.

Two mappings are not identity: `longtext` emits `longtextV2`, and `clozeformula`
emits `clozeformulaV2` — so Learnosity's own `clozeformula` ("Cloze math") is
*unmapped* despite the name collision.

| Learnosity type | slug | L0176 keyword |

| Audio recorder | `audio` | — |
| Bow-tie | `bowtie` | `bowtie` |
| Chart | `simplechart` | — |
| Chemistry essay with rich text | `chemistryessayV2` | — |

# The block functions

The per-type sections above cover what a question compiles to. The functions
that wrap them were audited separately, after the types were done.

## `learnosity` → removed

**Status:** **fixed** — 2026-08-20

A pass-through: its transformer returned its argument unchanged, and
`items [...] {}` compiled identically without it. It wrapped only `items`;
`author` never used it. `spec.md` documented it as arity 2 while the lexicon had
it at arity 1 — a wrapper nobody had looked at closely enough to notice.

## `items` → one record per entry

**Status:** **fixed** — 2026-08-20

`createItems` opened with `const [ item ] = items` and discarded the rest.
Two items compiled clean and emitted one question, and `spec.md` carried an
example that did exactly that. It now builds a record per entry.

Two reference schemes had to change, and one of them has a cost:

- Item references are `graffiticode-{lrn-id}-{n}` from zero, where they were
  `graffiticode-{lrn-id}`. **Every item already in the bank is orphaned** — the
  next save writes a new item beside it rather than updating it. Accepted
  deliberately; the alternative was suffixing only from the second item, which
  keeps existing references at the cost of a rule with an exception in it.
- Question references gained the item ordinal. Two items each opening with an
  `mcq` both produced `artcompiler-mcq-{id}-0` before.

Rendering still flattens every item's questions into one list, because it goes
through the Questions API with inline data. Item grouping is not visible in the
preview, and would need the Items API — which cannot render unpublished items.

## `params` → items level

**Status:** **fixed** — 2026-08-20

Declared on an item, but read off `items[0]` and used to build one
`dynamic_content_data` for the whole render, because Learnosity attaches one
table per rendered activity. It is now a member of the `items` list, which is
what it always described.

`params` stays a name that is not a Learnosity field, unlike everything in the
question vocabulary. `getDynamicContentData` derives `dynamic_content_data` from
it — `cols` from the first row's keys, `rows` keyed by a generated reference
carrying a timestamp — and that emitted shape is not hand-writable, so
transcription has no target here.

## `features` and `layout` → removed

**Status:** **fixed** — 2026-08-20

Both were in the lexicon with working transformers that put `features` / `layout`
onto the item record, and `createItems` read neither. Documented in `spec.md` as
"(placeholder)", which was generous: nothing placeheld, the value evaporated. If
item-level features land later they arrive with a consumer, which is when the
vocabulary should.

# What is not settled

The per-type queue above is finished. Two things it cannot close:

**The register's three behavioural questions have been rendered and closed.**
C1 (which scoring methods exist), C2 (which `options` keys they honour) and C8
(how bow-tie response indices are numbered) were all questions no amount of
further reading would answer. A render session against the live Questions API
answered all three, and overturned the corpus on each — see
`packages/core/spec/conflict-resolution.md`, which now records the measurements
and the technique.

- **C1**: Learnosity's scorer, handed an impossible method name, printed its own
  enumeration. `isSimplified`, `isFactorised` and `isUnit` — the three L0176
  inherited from L0158 that appear in no Learnosity article — are all real.
  `stringMatch` is real too and is *not* `equivLiteral`: it compares characters,
  so `1 / 2` fails against `1/2`. An unknown method is rejected at render time
  and scores every response 0, which is why the compiler now checks it.
- **C2**: the two-set split is a documentation artifact — `options` is one shared
  bag, and keys documented only for chemistry are honoured on `clozeformulaV2`.
  Unknown keys are ignored in silence, so there is nothing to check against.
- **C8**: cumulative global indexing, confirmed twice, including on uneven groups
  where a per-group scheme cannot express the indices at all. The docs' worked
  example is simply wrong.

**The converted question types themselves still have not been rendered.** The
probes were hand-built activity JSON signed directly, precisely so they could
take shapes L0176 cannot emit. Compiling proves the shape; only a render proves
the behaviour, and that matters more now than it did, because transcription means
L0176 checks very little of what it emits.

What the language gives up by transcribing, deliberately, in one place so it is
not a surprise:

| Was checked | Now |
| :---------- | :-- |
| `bowtie` 2-1-2 shape, and answers present in their pool | nothing — but the index scheme is now confirmed, C8 |
| `token-highlight` tokens present in the passage | nothing |
| `clozeformula` answer-combination count | nothing |
| `method` against a known list | **restored** — checked against Learnosity's own enumeration, C1 |

What it gained in exchange: the whole documented attribute surface of every type,
per-type rejection of attributes that are not the type's own, per-type
`scoring-type` validation, and several shapes that were previously unwritable —
predicate methods with no `value`, `classification`'s two-dimensional grid,
`token-highlight`'s non-custom tokenization, and `distractor_rationale_response_level`.
